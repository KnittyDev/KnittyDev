## 🧠 Who Am I?

I’m a **full-stack oriented developer** who enjoys turning ideas into real, working products — often starting with **zero budget**.
I focus on **thinking in systems**, not just writing code.

I’ve worked on and explored projects in **real estate, fintech, SaaS, and game development**.

* 🚀 I enjoy the full journey: Idea → MVP → Launch → Scale
* 🧩 I analyze problems with both **technical and business** perspectives
* 🛠️ I can ship complete products solo

## 🧠 My Coding Philosophy

```txt
• Think in systems first
• Then write the code
• Avoid unnecessary complexity
• If the user doesn’t understand it, the system is wrong
```

> “Clean code isn’t less code. It’s understandable code.”

## 🧩 A Small Note

If you’re reading this, you’re probably:

* building something
* thinking about an idea
* or looking for a better way

I won’t say you’re in the wrong place.
But here, you’ll find **thought-out systems**, not shortcuts.

⭐ *If you learned something, leave a star. If something feels unclear, open an issue.*
